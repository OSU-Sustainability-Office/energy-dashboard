The following text shows the conversation with the webserver where the 
AcquiSuite does not supply the correct form variable.  Note the lines 
starting with "-->" show what was sent to the server, and "<--" is what 
is returned by the server.  Also note the POST form variables are 
not shown in this example.

The first blank line returned by the server indicates the end of the 
header. (following the Content-Type line).  Lines starting after the 
blank line are considered the html body of the response.

The body line starting with "FAILURE:" is the key the AcquiSuite uses
to determine that the upload transaction failed. 

The body line starting with "NOTES:" is for information purposes only. 
The AcquiSuite will ignore this line, however it will be displayed to
the user if the user has selected the AcquiSuite upload connection test
page.
