The following text shows the conversation with the webserver where the 
AcquiSuite does not supply the correct serial nubmer and password.
Note the lines starting with "-->" show what was sent to the server,
and "<--" is what is returned by the server. 

The first blank line returned by the server indicates the end of the 
header. (following the Content-Type line).  Lines starting after the 
blank line are considered the html body of the response.

The body line starting with "FAILURE:" is the key the AcquiSuite uses
to determine that the upload transaction failed. 

The body line starting with "NOTES:" is for information purposes only. 
The AcquiSuite will ignore this line, however it will be displayed to
the user if the user has selected the AcquiSuite upload connection test
page.
