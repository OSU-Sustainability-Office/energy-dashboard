The AcquiSuite has the ability to push data to a webserver 
through a number of communications paths.  For LAN and Phone
based connections, the actual data send (in bytes) in not
usually an issue.  For GSM/GPRS Cellular, the amount of 
data matters as cellular providers bill based on data transfer.
For Cingular, accounts vary from $20 for 5M/month, $30 for 10M/month
etc. 

The following is an estimate of data transfer requirements 
for the AcquiSuite.

The following configurations were used in all tests:

    Log interval: 15 minutes
    Data upload time: daily (after hours)
    No upload retires on error. (on attempt per day)
    Onboard IO, with 3 pulses active.
    No external modbus devices.
    Operated for approximately 1 day with a minimum of 96 log entries. 
    No configuration files are exchanged over the link.
   
There are several components to the log transfer.  These include
a DNS lookup for the URL, DNS lookup for the time server, time sync,
and a number of HTTP/POST messages for Status, Logfiles, and 
configuration exchange.  The following is a list of these in 
the order they are typically processed by the AcquiSuite.

DNS lookup for URL:   (total 278 bytes)
   out:   90 bytes
   in:   188 bytes

HTTP Post status information:  (total 1939 bytes)
   out: 1766 bytes
   in:   173 bytes

HTTP Post log file upload: (total 6085 bytes, est)
   out: 2228 bytes (http overhead)
   out: 3500 bytes (compressed log file)
   in:   357 bytes

HTTP Post configuration manifest request:   (total 1718 bytes)
   out: 1369 bytes
   in:   349 bytes

DNS lookup for Time server: (total 278 bytes)
   out:   90 bytes
   in:   188 bytes

Time sync:  (total 548 bytes)
   out: 270 bytes
   in:  278 bytes

The total for such a session would come to approximately 
10846 bytes  (10.6k).  Note however this only lists 
the actual data sent via the TCP protocol.  It does not
measure the overhead of the TCP socket, nor the PPP layer
used to connect to the cellular network.

The following is a more accurate measurement of the 
AcquiSuite data transfer measured by monitoring the
PPP device layer, to monitor bytes sent/received over
the serial/GSM link.  This measurement includes all 
of the transfers listed above. 

Complete session:  15654 bytes (15.3k)
    out: 10691 bytes
    in:   4963 bytes

Note, it is interesting that the PPP link layer and 
TCP/IP socket layer add almost 30% to the transaction.

A second upload test with loggerconfig.ini exchange
Complete session:  17085 bytes (16.7k)  
    out: 14073 bytes 
    in:   3012 bytes


Based on this measurement of the system, the acquisuite
should consume approximately 480K bytes of data transfer
in one month as it uploads data on a daily basis.

--------------
Additional uploads:
log file: 221575 bytes raw, 24576 bytes compressed.
send one logfile, one config file (loggerconfig.ini)
ppp transfer: 44896 sent, 4255 received.
