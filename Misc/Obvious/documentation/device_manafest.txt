The AcquiSuite can provide a text based list of attached modbus devices. 
the following URL can be used to obtain this list:

	http://192.168.40.45/setup/logexport.cgi?MB=0

The resulting data will be in plain text format, witht he following columns:

	Modbus ID,DeviceName,DeviceType,DeviceClass,Log File URL

The following is an example:

Modbus ID,DeviceName,DeviceType,DeviceClass,Log File URL
002,"Loading Dock Temp","Veris HXO/T-485-M, Outdoor Humidity/Temperature",1,logexport.cgi/444D5000060A_2.txt?MB=2 
037,"Veris H8036","Veris H8036-0100-2, Full-Data, Modbus, 100 Amp",2,logexport.cgi/444D5000060A_37.txt?MB=37


This is primarily a CSV version of the modbus device list page, and is used by EnertraxDL.
