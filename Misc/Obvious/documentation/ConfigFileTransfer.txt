Configuration file transfer:

The AcquiSuite and AcquiLite can exchange configuration information
with the database server.  This allows remote configuration ability
for your DAS systems deployed in the field.

In order to get the AcquiSuite to exchange config files with your 
server, you must respond to the MODE=CONFIGFILEMANIFEST request. 

This request is made after all the log file data is transferred, 
and is the way the AcquiSuite decides what configuration files 
need to be transferred.  The manifest response should contain a 
number of lines, each calling out a configuration file that you 
wish to exchange, the checksum and time modified for each.  The 
AcquiSuite will only send you files that it finds do not match
the files your server reports in the manifest.  

On the first upload, you should specify the config file names, 
and use blank for the checksum, and blank for the last modified 
date/time. This will cause the AcquiSuite to detect the checksum 
mismatch and to always send you the config because the date of 
the AcquiSuite config will be newer.

If the date reported in the manifest is newer than the timestamp 
on the A.S, and the "allow remote config" feature is enabled, 
the A.S. will use MODE=CONFIGFILEDOWNLOAD to obtain the config 
file from your server.


The config file manifest response contains the following information
        
    CONFIGFILE,loggerconfig.ini,md5checksum,timestamp
    CONFIGFILE,modbus/mb-001.ini,md5checksum,timestamp
    CONFIGFILE,modbus/mb-007.ini,md5checksum,timestamp
                                
the timestamp is in UTC time, SQL format, ie "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" 
(use blank if not present/first-time)

The md5checksum is the md5 checksum of the config file. 
(use blank if not present/first-time)
          
Checksums and timestamps are stored in a database, file data 
can be stored in the same table as a blob record. When a config 
file is received from the AcquiSuite, the server should verify 
the checksum, save the config file and also save the timestamp 
and checksum for the file for future reference.  
          
The AcquiSuite will process this response, and only exchange 
files listed in the manifest response.
          
If the config file checksum sent in the response does not 
match the AcquiSuite config file checksum, the AcquiSuite 
will process the exchange.  If "remote configuration" is 
enabled, the AcquiSuite will check the timestamp to find if 
the server version of the config file is newer than the 
AcquiSuite version .if so the AcquiSuite will request to 
download the configuration file from the server. 
          
If the checksum values do not match and the AcquiSuite 
file timestamp is newer, or if the server timestamp is 
blank, or if the "remote configuration" option is not enabled, 
the AcquiSuite will send the configuration file to the server.

When deciding what config files to request on the first 
pass upload, always request the loggerconfig.ini, and then
create an entry for each log file (by modbus address) that you
see a log file upload transfer request.  ie, if you got data
for modbus device 1, create a manifest entry for modbus/mb-001.ini


----------------------------------------------------------------------

The config file name should be formed as follows:

for system:
        loggerconfig.ini

for meters:
        modbus/mb-001.ini


The file names/paths are relative to /etc/sysconfig/ on the 
AcquiSuite system, if you are reviewing the files using a tool 
such as FTP to view configuration files. 


To generate the file name:
  -  use the directory name "modbus/" for all modbus meters.
  -  the file name should start with "mb-"  
  -  format the device id number using 3 digit printing.  e.g.  250 or 001.
  -  end the file name in ".ini"


example   "modbus/mb-001.ini"


The file name of the log file sent in the log file upload 
was not intended  to be parsed and used to generate a file 
name to match the config file.   Use the form variables 
from the data upload to identify the modbus device configured 
on the AcquiSuite system.

AcquiLite systems can be handled the same way; the onboard 
pulse inputs always act as modbus device address 1.

A slightly different procedure should be used to handle A8812 
sensor network device config files (mbs-12345.ini)  however 
these can be identified by the modbusdevicenumber being -1.  
This only applies to point6, bapi, and orion transmitters. 

This information is applicable to all versions of the AcquiSuite 
product and firmware.
