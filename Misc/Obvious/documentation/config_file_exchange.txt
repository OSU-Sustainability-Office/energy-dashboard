The AcquiSutie and AcquiLite make several requests to your
php script to process log and configuration information.  The
request that contains the log file will not contain the config file.

To receive a config file from the AcquiSuite or AcquiLite, you 
must perform a two step process.  

Note: the following is in PHP syntax.  ASP can be used to do the
same function, however examples are beyond the scope of this document.

First, the AcquiSuite or AcquiLite will send a request to your
php script where the  $_REQUEST['MODE'] == "CONFIGFILEMANIFEST"

When you receive this request, the AcquiSuite is requesting 
information about what config files your php script can exchange
with the client.  Your PHP script should respond with  the following
text:

    CONFIGFILE,loggerconfig.ini,md5checksum,timestamp
    CONFIGFILE,modbus/mb-001.ini,md5checksum,timestamp
    CONFIGFILE,modbus/mb-007.ini,md5checksum,timestamp

This information represents what configuration files your server 
has received and stored in the past.  This way, the AcquiSuite
or AcquiLite will only upload configuration information that is
different from what you already have. 

For the first transfer, you can report the line as follows:

    CONFIGFILE,loggerconfig.ini,X,0000-00-00 00:00:00

This will cause the AcquiSuite or AcquiLite to always upload
the config file.    For more info on this transfer, please review
the file "process_manifest.php" in the php directory of the
sample upload kit. 

Next, the AcquiSuite or AcquiLite will attempt to send the
configuration information in a separate file. This request
will have the following:

    $_REQUEST['MODE'] == "CONFIGFILEUPLOAD"

For this type of request, the php script can access the attached
file with the following syntax:

    $fd = fopen($_FILES['CONFIGFILE']['tmp_name'], "r");

For more information on this, review the file "process_configfileupload.php" 
in the upload kit.
