Contact closure outputs can be changed using an HTTP transaction 
with the AcquiSuite A8812, Data Acquisition Server.  The AcquiSuite 
will support the operation with either GET or POST so you can 
encode the command in a URL for ease of use in an AJAX enabled web 
page. 

The cgi tool that processes this request is /setup/relaywidget.cgi
on the AcquiSuite system.

The following are the form variables that are processed to change
the output state.


    OPTION=SETRELAY
    ADDRESS=250         [ modbus address of device, 1-255 allowd]
    POINT=40            [ data point number ]
    STATE=ON            [ ON or OFF ]

The following are the form variables that are processed to report
the current state.

    OPTION=GETRELAY 
    ADDRESS=250         [ modbus address of device, 1-255 allowd]
    POINT=40            [ data point number ]
    CACHE=YES           [ optional, set to YES or NO]


The output from the relaywidget.cgi tool will provide an xml style
report of the current status of the output terminals. 

    <relayoutput>
      <address>250</address>
      <point>40</point>
      <state>1</state>
    </relayoutput>

Note, the same result is given for both the SETRELAY and GETRELAY options
shown above.  Point 40 corresponds to the data point in the A8812 onboard
i/o modbus interface page.  Note that the points are numberd 0 to 41, and
the relay points are the last two data point items.

The cgi tool is protected with HTTP Basic Authenticaion.  You must
provide a http request with proper authentication encoded in the 
post data.  Typically, your web browser will prompt and request
this information from you, however if you are creating an automated
tool, you will need to add the auth info.  The relaywidget.cgi expects
the "admin" login name and password and will reject all others. 

Example: 
The following url will request the output 1 be turned on the A8812.
You can test this url in a standard browser such as MSIE or Firefox.

    http://192.168.40.50/setup/relaywidget.cgi?OPTION=SETRELAY&ADDRESS=250&POINT=40&STATE=ON
