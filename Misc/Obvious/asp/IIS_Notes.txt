Notes on Microsoft Webserver (IIS).

The problem: the AcquiSuite sends username/password information 
in the upload session as "Basic HTTP Authentication" method.   
IIS will allow Basic HTTP authentication only if there is a 
corresponding user account in the Windows domain space.  
ie, the administrator must create a windows domain login 
for every AcquiSuite.

 - in windows iis setup, the checkbox "Userspace Authentication"
   Allows anonymous access,  or requires an NT domain space 
   login for each AcquiSuite.

Other notes: (client is using VB script.)
use GetHeaderCollection to get http header values.
authentication header information is aparently stripped 
if anonymous access is allowed. This makes it hard/impossible
to use IIS in anonymous mode (allow all connections) and then 
check the password later in the vb/asp script.


Solution: v01.04.0618 and later versions of the AcquiSuite 
firmware provide login/password information in the form 
variable area to allow IIS with Anonymous access to check 
the password values
